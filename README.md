# Overview

I am seeking to continue developing my knowledge and skill set in web development by learning React, a JavaScript library developed by Facebook. React enables more streamlined production and maintenance of large-scale websites and web applications. Learning React will further enhance my employability as it is a very popular library and allow me to keep my code more modular and reusable, reducing the time it takes me to develop a website. 

The website that I have developed is a single page portfolio wbesite to show employers and clients my skills and experience. Each section of the website is it's own component, split into separate JavaScript files and then exported to a main App.js file to construct the web page itself. In order to see my application on your own test server, clone the repository and make sure you are in the project's directory. Then make sure you have npm installed. Once that has been completed, run "npm run start" in the terminal. This should automatically start the server and take you to the webpage in your browser. If it does not take you to the page, open your browser and enter the address "http://localhost:3000".

I decided to pursue the challenge of learning React because I have only ever used vanilla JavaScript and wanted to learn a popular library or framework. My employer at the time of the creation of this site was also seeking a new Software Engineer with React experience, which is something that I lacked. Tackling this project allows me to show employers that I am familar with React and can use it, while also showing them some of my other projects and skills.

# Web Pages

The website is currently a single page portfolio, introducing who I am, what my skills are, and showcasing some of the projects that I am working on or have worked on. This web page was created using React. 

Dynamic Content: 

* The navigation within the "Education & Accomplishments" section dynamically loads content based on user selection.
* The project carousel allows users to navigate through different projects with "Previous Project" and "Next Project" buttons.

# Future Work

* Add more projects to the project carousel 
* Flesh-out the descriptions of the projects
* Flesh-out the skills and technologies section
* Add contact information in addition to the link to my GitHub profile
* Enhance styling for mobile
* Learn Bootstrap or Tailwind and convert the vanilla CSS to use one of those libraries
* Eventually add a "Work Experience" section once I have on-job experience
